# BiologyModel
Project for Grade 12 Biology modelling heat loss and homeostasis using numerical derivatives

For my model, I will assume based on published results that the coefficient of emissivity of human skin and clothing is around unity.
Also, I will be assuming that the specific heat capacity for a human body is approxiamately the specific heat capacity of water, or 4186 J/kg.
